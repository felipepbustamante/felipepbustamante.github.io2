I"<p>Call me <em>Ishmael</em>. Some years ago–<em>never mind how long
precisely</em>–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
little
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving
off
the spleen and regulating the circulation.

Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a
damp,
drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
pausing
before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I
meet;
and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that
it
requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately
stepping</p>
